          <div class="coin-desc">"A part of all I earn is mine to keep." Pay yourself first by saving 10% of what you earn. If you don't start saving for the long term, your money will never fail to slip away.</div>

        <div class="coin-back">
          <div class="coin-desc">Control what you're spending on, and avoid spending on luxuries. Many "needs" are really just wants, and they'll grow to take your whole income if you don't stop them.</div>

          <div class="coin-desc">"A man's wealth is not in the coins he carries; it is in the income he buildeth." Sitting on your savings will only make them diminish. To create wealth you <i>must</i> invest your money.</div>

        <div class="coin-back">
          <div class="coin-desc">Be careful with your investments. Someone being a good salesman doesn't mean they're a good advisor. Losing your investment not only loses you the money you put in, but also the money that money could have made for you in better investments. Ask for advice from people with investing experience.</div>

          <div class="coin-desc" style="padding: 40px; top: calc(50% + 5px);">I noticed that this book has a lot of stuff about self-image besides the financial advise. This one is both. Owning a house could be cheaper in the long run, and it builds your confidence and independence. The book is also from the 1920s, though, and this tip might not apply as well for a lot of people today.</div>

This could look like going to school, getting a certificate, seeking mentors, or just actively learning to be more effective in whatever you do for money. This could also apply to learning more about investing the money you have.</div>
